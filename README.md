# BASIC Player Movement:
Hey, this is my first 3D project! I'm learning C# from Brackeys, so I thought I should post my "learnings".
# Setup:
Make a playee object in Unity. It    can be anything! a cube, circle,      etc.. 

Then, add the BasicPlayerMovement  script to it, and make a Rigidbody.   MAKE SURE IT HAS GRAVITY ENABLED.  Then, drag your rigidbody to the corresponding container, and you can then adjust the move speeds from the bottom containers. After that, add a camera, and then add the FollowPlayer script to it. In the container labeled "player" add your player object, and your done! Now if you press W, A, S, or D, your player will move in the corresponding direction. Enjoy!
